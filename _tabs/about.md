Hello everyone, I go by the alias of 2lazy and this is my tech blog!
I made this blog to moreover talk about my work in the field of IT like programming,
reverse engineering, code review, computer networking, game hacking, bug bounty,
and so on.

I am a 17 year old collage student born in the Republic of Moldova. I enjoy developing things, breaking things and see how they work. Which made my passion in computers.

I also enjoy music, reading, watching movies and science.
